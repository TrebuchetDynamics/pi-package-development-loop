# Page Quality

Read only the sections relevant to the current task. Paths and commands are relative to the skill directory unless stated otherwise. The entrypoint workflow and user constraints take precedence over these reference defaults.

## 16. MULTI-IMAGE CONSISTENCY RULE
Because every section is its own image, consistency is critical. Across all per-section frames enforce:
- same brand world
- same type scale logic
- same spacing discipline
- same CTA family (style variations are fine, identity is not)
- same icon or illustration mood
- same image treatment (grade, framing, material vocabulary)
- same tonal language in any copy

Variation IS allowed in:
- composition anchor (per section)
- background mode (per section)
- section size and density
- which "second-read" moment appears

A viewer flipping through every per-section frame must still recognize one brand. Anything that breaks brand recall is over-variation.

## 17. CLARITY CHECK
Before finalizing, verify internally:

1. Is the hierarchy obvious?
2. Is the hero clean enough?
3. Is the design visually distinctive?
4. Is it free of obvious AI tells?
5. Is it premium rather than template-like?
6. Can someone code from this?
7. If multiple images exist, do they clearly belong together?
8. Is imagery used strongly enough (with variation, not one repeated crop)?
9. Does the page breathe, or is it too dense?
10. Is there enough spacing between sections?
11. Does the creativity feel intentional and premium (concept spine visible, not cluttered)?
12. Is the spacing between sections even and controlled?
13. Do smaller sections still have enough surrounding space to feel clean?
14. Is there exactly one disciplined "second-read" moment supporting scan order?
15. Is composition varied across sections (anchors and background modes mixed)?
16. Is the hero scale (giant / mid / mini) chosen and executed cleanly?
17. Is there a clear conversion path (hook -> proof -> action) even in artistic sites?
18. Is the palette consistent across all per-section images?
19. Is each image horizontal and one-section-only?
20. Is the **total number of images equal to the number of sections** (never fewer)?
21. Is the hero using a varied composition (not defaulting to left-text / right-image out of habit)?

If not, refine internally before output. If the count is wrong, regenerate the missing sections. If the hero feels like a reflexive left-text / right-image default, prefer a different composition anchor.

## 18. EXTRA CREATIVITY & IMPLEMENTATION EDGE

Apply unless the user opts out:

### Cross-section contrast
Across the slice, deliberately vary foreground/background intensity at least twice (lighter → richer → calmer) so the scroll feels paced, not monotonous slabs.

### CTA specificity
Prefer one unmistakable primary action per major viewport tier; secondary actions must look secondary (scale, outline, ghost), not clones of primary.

### Image variety inside one comp
Mix at least **two distinct image crops** where multiple sections exist — e.g. macro product + contextual environment, or portrait editorial + widescreen artifact — avoiding one repeated stock silhouette.

### Data-viz restraint
Charts, sparklines, and graphs appear only when the site type logically needs them (analytics, pricing, infra, observability brands). Else keep proof human (quotes, receipts, timelines, screenshots of real workflows).

### Cultural / tonal alignment
When the brief names an industry or region, steer palette and typographic temperament to match — don’t ship default “neutral SF startup” unless the brief is intentionally generic SaaS.

### Mobile-implied fidelity (even for desktop mocks)
Maintain tap-friendly hit sizes and readable caption sizes visually; stacking order should imply a sane single-column narrative.

### Conversion focus
Each section has a job. Even when the design is artistic, the page must read as a real product or brand site:
- the hero communicates value in seconds and offers one obvious next action
- proof sections (logos, quotes, metrics) feel earned, not stuffed
- pricing or CTA sections feel decisive, not buried
- the final section closes: a single strong CTA + supporting trust cue
Avoid pure mood reels with no funnel logic.

### Composition variety check
Across all per-section images, internally log the chosen composition anchor and background mode. Reject the set if:
- the same composition anchor repeats more than 2 sections in a row
- the same background mode repeats more than 3 sections in a row
- every section is inline-asset (no full-bleed background ever appears) **AND** the brief does not call for minimalism / typography-only / swiss / ultra simple

For non-minimalist briefs: push for at least one full-bleed (or duotone / atmospheric) background and at least one mini minimalist section in any multi-section site.

For minimalist briefs: this rule is suspended. Restraint is the design.

## 19. RESPONSE BEHAVIOR
When the user asks for a frontend design:
1. infer site type and primary conversion goal
2. infer number of sections (if unclear, use the defaults from §5: landing page = 6, full website = 8)
3. **commit out loud** to the section count and announce it ("Generating N horizontal images, one per section")
4. plan ONE horizontal image PER SECTION — always separate generations, never collapse
5. choose Hero Scale for the whole site (giant / mid / mini)
5. choose a strong visual combination (theme, type, hero arch, section system, motion, narrative spine, second-read moment)
7. for each section: pick a Composition Anchor, Background Mode, and CTA Variation — vary across sections
8. choose 4 signature components used appropriately across sections
9. enforce hero minimalism + section size variety (some giant, some mini)
10. enforce strong image usage including full-bleed backgrounds where it fits
11. lock one consistent palette across all images
12. apply §18 EXTRA CREATIVITY & IMPLEMENTATION EDGE
13. keep spacing generous, even, and clean
14. remove AI slop (including marquee / fake KPI clichés unless requested)
15. run §17 CLARITY CHECK
16. **generate every per-section horizontal image, labeled "Section X of N: <name>"**, until the full set is delivered. Do not stop early. Do not summarize. Do not return only one image.

Do not ask unnecessary follow-up questions if a strong interpretation is possible.

## 20. EXAMPLE INTERPRETATIONS

### Example 1
User: "make a hero section for an AI startup"

Interpretation:
- 1 horizontal image
- Hero Scale: Mid Editorial or Giant Statement
- Composition Anchor: bottom-left text over full-bleed product/atmosphere image
- Background Mode: full-bleed image with dark tonal overlay
- CTA Variation: outlined inline + small label hint
- Palette: Deep Dark or Bold Studio Solid, one consistent accent
- no cliche dashboard spam, no purple AI glow

### Example 2
User: "design 8 sections for a fintech website"

Interpretation:
- 8 separate horizontal images (one per section)
- Hero Scale: Mid Editorial (trust-driven)
- vary Composition Anchor across sections (centered low, right-third caption, bottom-left over chart visual, stacked center for closing CTA)
- Background Mode mix: solid surface, full-bleed image background once, editorial side-image at use cases
- one consistent palette (e.g. ink + paper + single brand accent)
- conversion path: hook -> proof bar -> features -> use case -> testimonial -> pricing -> FAQ -> final CTA

### Example 3
User: "creative agency landing page, 12 sections"

Interpretation:
- 12 horizontal images (one per section)
- Hero Scale: Giant Statement OR Mini Minimalist (decisive choice, not in-between)
- editorial / poster-like direction; off-grid composition appears 2-3 times
- multiple Background Modes (full-bleed image at hero + showcase, editorial side-image at case studies, solid + accent for process)
- palette consistent throughout, with one bold accent recurring
- closing CTA section: mini minimalist, strong type, single primary action

## 21. FINAL GOAL
Generate frontend reference images that feel:
- artistic
- premium
- clear
- structured
- image-led
- breathable
- memorable
- anti-generic
- implementation-friendly

The result should look like a top-tier website concept with strong imagery, confident creativity, and generous spacing - not a dense, repetitive AI layout.
